# thing-tracker

Like a todo list, but more customizable

## examples

-   Categories: Workout, Plant Care, Cleaning
-   Thing types: recurring todos, one-time todos, activities, notes
-   Things:
    -   recurring todo with set frequency: pullups on jugs daily, and track amount done
    -   recurring todo with variable frequency: endurance laps every gym visit
    -   recurring todo with range of frequency: water palm plant every 8-10 days
    -   one-time todo: amazon return
    -   activity: climb at the gym, take notes of grades climbed and any noteworthy climbs
    -   daily mood gauge
